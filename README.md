# websiteDev
A temporary repository to work on the RepLAB website without affecting it. To use this project, run the associated GitHub action. It runs Sphinx on the `develop` branch of `https://www.github.com/replab/replab` and pushes the resulting website onto [https://replab.github.io/websiteDev](https://replab.github.io/websiteDev).
